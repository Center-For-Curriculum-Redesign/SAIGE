              "Previous research has documented schemes and operations that undergird students' understanding of fractions. This prior research was based, in large part, on small-group teaching experiments. However, written assessments are needed in order for teachers and researchers to assess students' ways of operating on a whole-class scale. In this study, scores from written instruments used to assess students' fractions schemes and operations were examined for validity and reliability. Scores from the written assessments were correlated with scores from clinical interviews of 33 sixth graders. Results suggest that the written instruments provide reliable and valid measures for assessing the partitive unit fraction scheme and the splitting operation. However, there is no such evidence regarding the partitive fraction scheme. Implications for teachers and researchers are considered, and possible explanations for the scores from the written assessments related to the partitive fraction scheme are discussed. (Contains 3 tables, 5 figures, and 4 endnotes.)",
              "The aim of this study is revealing the strategies used by 5th-grade students in comparing fractions. In line with this purpose the study is based on qualitative research. Participants of the study conducted with convenient sampling method are seventy 5th-grade students. The students have been asked six questions which necessitate comparison of fraction pairs, considering the sample questions included in mathematics textbook within the limitations of 5th-grade gains on fractions. In addition, for the purpose of revealing the strategies of students in comparing fractions in more detail, face-to-face interviews are held with ten students. The students interviewed have been selected from among those who use different strategies, apply the rules and make faulty reasoning. In order to ensure the validity and reliability of the research, research data are checked by another researcher and similar themes and categories to the ones found by the researcher are reached. Collected data are analyzed by using content analysis and the strategies that the students use in comparing fractions are tried to be determined. As a result of the analyses, it is seen that students mostly prefer &quot;Applying the Rules&quot; where they use procedural information. It is determined that the number of students who prefer &quot;Strategy Development and Discovery&quot; which require conceptual comprehension is less than others. The findings show that consideration of conceptual and procedural comprehension in comparing fractions and not imposing rules on students and ensuring the students reach the rule is important.

              "Teams of educators conducted lesson study independently, supported by a resource kit that included mathematical tasks, curriculum materials, lesson videos and plans, and research articles, as well as protocols to support lesson study. The mathematical resources focused on linear measurement interpretation of fractions. This report examines the resource kit content, the changes in teachers' fractions knowledge, and the lesson study processes that enabled changes in teachers' knowledge. Quantitative findings show that teachers in the experimental condition (lesson study supported by resource kits) significantly improved three of the four facets of fractions knowledge studied, including understanding the whole, unit fractions, and fractions as numbers; whereas control group teachers did not. Qualitative data, including video and written reflections, illuminate activities that supported teachers' knowledge development, including solving and discussing mathematical tasks, studying curriculum and research, and observing students during research lessons.",
              "The efficacy of a research-based fraction sense intervention for sixth graders with or at risk for mathematics difficulties (N = 52) was examined. The intervention aimed to build understanding of fraction magnitudes on the number line. Key concepts were taught with a narrow range of denominators to develop deep understanding. The intervention was centered on a visual number line in the meaningful context of a color run race. Students were randomly assigned to the fraction sense intervention (n = 25) or a business-as-usual control group (n = 27). Students in the intervention condition received 21 lessons in small groups (45 min each) during their regular mathematics intervention period. Students in the intervention group performed significantly better than those in the control group on a measure of fraction number line estimation and a more general measure of fraction concepts, both at immediate posttest and delayed posttest, with large effect sizes; lesser effects were shown for fraction arithmetic.

              "This paper presents an analysis of fractions errors displayed by learners due to deficient mastery of prerequisite concepts. Fractions continue to pose a critical challenge for learners. Fractions can be a tricky concept for learners although they often use the concept of sharing in their daily lives. 30 purposefully sampled learners participated in this study. The research instrument consists of fractions test whose questions were selected from various Annual National Assessment examination papers containing in addition, subtraction multiplication and division of fractional operations. The different types of errors displayed by learners were then identified, coded and categorized. The analysis showed that the main sources for errors were lack of understanding of the basic concepts, learners' prior knowledge, misconceptions and misapplication of rules. This study recommends that teachers should help their learners to develop fractions conceptual understanding. Learners need to be explicitly taught that errors are opportunities for learning, and that they are springboard of inquiry.",

Concepts such as the relationship between language majority groups and language minority groups, language status, immigration, economics, language planning, and policies add to the complexity of language-learning situations. Effective teachers for the more than 5 million English learners (ELs) in kindergarten through 12th grades require unique knowledge, skills, and dispositions.

              "This quasi-experimental study examined an eighteen-month professional development project focused on improving instructional practices for emerging bilingual and multilingual English learners (ELs). The study is grounded in sociocultural and interactive learning theories related to teaching ELs. Professional development activities included seven graduate-level courses, practical field experiences in schools, instructional coaching from peers and a qualified instructional coach, video demonstrations and observations, and participation in a one-day conference. The research team conducted pre and post classroom observations for 23 in-service teachers and corroborated findings with participant reflections about instructional practices using the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP). Results reveal that participants made statistically significant increases in seven of the eight areas of instruction: lesson preparation, building background, strategies, interaction, practice/application, lesson delivery, and review/assessment, and no significant change in the area of comprehensible input. The control group showed no significant increases. The discussion identifies strong areas of improvement, moderate areas of improvement, and discusses the one area that showed no significant improvement. Implications for teacher education and professional learning with teachers of ELs are shared along with considerations for future research.",

They analyze preservice teachers' ELL adaptations implemented in a one-on-one setting. Through qualitative methods, four themes regarding implemented adaptations are identified: language adaptations, mathematical adaptations, tool/visual adaptations, and structural adaptations. The authors conclude that the framework was successful in helping preservice teachers learn about adapting curriculum by interacting with ELLs. Implications for teacher education are discussed.",

I also investigated how to expand my students' background knowledge. Furthermore, I studied how to minimize the consequences of teaching kindergarten to grade 4 in a multigrade classroom. The final learning barrier was how to obtain beneficial instructional methods on my school's inadequate budget.

              "This qualitative study examined how participating in-service teachers demonstrated linguistically and culturally responsive mathematical teaching (LCRMT) competences after they completed a year-long National Professional Development Program grant-funded project. A two-dimensional LCRMT framework was developed to measure participating teachers' mathematical and mathematics-related competences. The qualitative data source was from three in-service teachers' observations and interviews. The interview and observation data were analyzed using open and axial coding and activity systems. Three themes emerged: 1) mathematics-related content teaching practices, 2) tools to support mathematics learning, and 3) teachers' mindsets and attitudes towards English Learner (EL) teaching. The researchers then compared verbatim examples using activity systems to examine the following research question: How did participating urban in-service teachers apply linguistically and culturally responsive mathematics teaching competences for ELs learned at a university EL teacher training program to their actual mathematics teaching in the classroom? The results, in general, indicated that the urban in-service teachers demonstrated improvement of LCRMT strategies that they used in their actual mathematics teaching after they completed the university training. However, challenges in the areas of mathematical discourse competences and teachers' sociocultural beliefs toward ELs revealed the need for ongoing professional support.",

              "In the current U.S. context, it is relevant to disseminate research that portrays in detail how bilingual teachers create challenging and safe mathematics learning environments for emergent bilinguals. It is critical to identify pedagogical approaches that foster emergent bilinguals' participation in mathematics conversations and discourse practices where language is considered a pedagogical resource. This is possible when teachers understand that young Latino/a students come to school with a wide range of cognitive and linguistic tools, which they can use to help them make sense of problems posed in the classroom. Using case study methodology, we define and provide a detailed portrayal of a bilingual kindergarten teacher´s mathematics pedagogical practices. Specifically we discuss: (a) the use of authentic &quot;mathematics stories,&quot; (b) the integration of multimodal representation of problem solving, and (c) collective thinking and representation of problem solving solutions. In addition, we analyze how the teacher fosters practices that use language as a learning resource. Finally, we argue that these practices promote a mathematics discourse community and that pedagogy of confidence, care, and understanding is at the core of this teacher's instructional approach.",
              "Demographic data show an increasingly diverse student population in all urban settings. This contrasts with the teacher force, which is predominately middle class, female, monolingual, and of European ancestry. This discrepancy adds complexity to an already complex profession. To bridge this cultural gap, researchers advocate for a change in the teaching paradigm, in which teachers understand the relationship between students' culture and learning. This paradigm is called Culturally Responsive Teaching. The participants of this study were twenty-two secondary mathematics and science teachers. The researcher analyzed whether some of the strategies used in mathematics and science urban classrooms were student-centered as well as culturally responsive. Results show that teachers used a variety of student-centered strategies, such as discovery learning, centers and group work, and games. Similarly, the teachers incorporated their students' culture into their mathematics and science classrooms, by including their students' interests in the lessons, exposing students to similar role models, and using real-life examples that students found relatable.",

              "Teams of educators conducted lesson study independently, supported by a resource kit that included mathematical tasks, curriculum materials, lesson videos and plans, and research articles, as well as protocols to support lesson study. The mathematical resources focused on linear measurement interpretation of fractions. This report examines the resource kit content, the changes in teachers' fractions knowledge, and the lesson study processes that enabled changes in teachers' knowledge. Quantitative findings show that teachers in the experimental condition (lesson study supported by resource kits) significantly improved three of the four facets of fractions knowledge studied, including understanding the whole, unit fractions, and fractions as numbers; whereas control group teachers did not. Qualitative data, including video and written reflections, illuminate activities that supported teachers' knowledge development, including solving and discussing mathematical tasks, studying curriculum and research, and observing students during research lessons.",
              "Fraction and decimal arithmetic pose large difficulties for many children and adults. This is a serious problem, because proficiency with these skills is crucial for learning more advanced mathematics and science and for success in many occupations. This review identifies two main classes of difficulties that underlie poor understanding of rational number arithmetic: inherent and culturally contingent. Inherent sources of difficulty are ones that are imposed by the task of learning rational number arithmetic, such as complex relations among fraction arithmetic operations, and that are present for all learners. Culturally contingent sources of difficulty are ones that vary among cultures, such as teacher understanding of rational numbers, and that lead to poorer learning among students in some places than others. We conclude by discussing interventions that can improve learning of rational number arithmetic.

              "Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) are beneficial for individual students learning in several domains, including mathematics where they have been used to support both secondary and elementary students. Collaborative learning may be beneficial to include in ITSs, particularly for conceptual knowledge. There is little work on collaborative ITSs, and it has mostly focused on older students. We aim to extend this work to elementary school students, by extending an ITS for fractions so it supports collaborative learning. We also build upon our previous work to further investigate the complementary strengths of collaborative and individual learning. In our study, 189 elementary school students worked with a conceptual or a procedural fractions ITS, and either individually or collaboratively. Students in both ITS conditions learned, but there were no differences in learning between individual and collaboration. However, the students working collaboratively spent less time on the tutor, indicating potential benefits of collaborative learning on efficiency in this setting.",
              "This study begins by connecting semantic elaboration with conceptual understanding and syntactic elaboration with procedural understanding in the context of fractions. Through case studies and discourse analysis, the work and communication of students in fourth through sixth grade is analyzed to determine the extent of their semantic and syntactic elaboration regarding fractions and fraction operations. Findings are that, while some students emphasized one form of elaboration over the other, some students demonstrated use of both forms of elaboration. Indeed, it is wondered if semantic and syntactic elaboration should be seen as more complementary than adversarial.",
              "From a curricular stand point, the traditional invert and multiply algorithm for division of fractions provides few affordances for linking to a rich understanding of fractions. On the other hand, an alternative algorithm, called common denominator algorithm, has many such affordances. The current study serves as an argument for shifting curriculum for fraction division from use of invert and multiply algorithm as a basis to the use of common denominator algorithm as a basis. This was accomplished with the analysis of learning of two prospective elementary teachers being an illustration of how to realize those conceptual affordances. In doing so, the article proposes an instructional sequence and details it by referring to both the (mathematical and pedagogical) advantages and the disadvantages. As a result, this algorithm has a conceptual basis depending on basic operations of partitioning, unitizing, and counting, which make it accessible to learners. Also, when participants are encouraged to construct this algorithm based on their work with diagrams, common denominator algorithm formalizes the work that they do with diagrams.",

              "Previous research has documented schemes and operations that undergird students' understanding of fractions. This prior research was based, in large part, on small-group teaching experiments. However, written assessments are needed in order for teachers and researchers to assess students' ways of operating on a whole-class scale. In this study, scores from written instruments used to assess students' fractions schemes and operations were examined for validity and reliability. Scores from the written assessments were correlated with scores from clinical interviews of 33 sixth graders. Results suggest that the written instruments provide reliable and valid measures for assessing the partitive unit fraction scheme and the splitting operation. However, there is no such evidence regarding the partitive fraction scheme. Implications for teachers and researchers are considered, and possible explanations for the scores from the written assessments related to the partitive fraction scheme are discussed.

              "The teaching and learning fractions is one of the most problematic areas in primary school mathematics. A large number of studies have engaged paper-and-pencil test to measure students' instrumental understanding about fractions but few have sought to learn about children's fraction sense. This paper reports a study that investigated fraction sense possessed by the Malaysian primary pupils. A 16-item Fraction Sense Test (FST) was developed and administered to a group of 198 Primary 4 pupils to test their fraction sense in solving problems about fractions. From the FST result, six respondents were selected from the low ability, intermediate ability, and high ability group. These respondents underwent a series of clinical interviews. Results show that the low and intermediate achievers lack fraction sense. The high achievers demonstrated flexibility in visualizing and recognizing the representations of unfamiliar fractions. They developed mental referents for fractions. They noticed the number of parts and were aware that these parts must be equal when comparing fractions. They could visualize and perform operations mentally with larger value numerators and denominators. They have good sense of estimation and applied equivalence of fractions. These findings are useful to teachers who prepare teaching activities to enhance fraction sense.",
              "In this paper characterizations of mental objects for fractions of middle school students (from 12 to 14 years old) with absenteeism problems and low academic performance, are described. A test was designed as part of a research whose general purpose is to contribute in the building up of better mental objects for fractions through a teaching sequence. Items for the test were structured according to the results of a didactic phenomenology of fractions and the curricular content proposed for the last years of elementary school. Results indicate that students have a greater success in issues related to continuous model partitions phenomena, whereas they are less successful using fractions on the number line. Students cannot transfer their knowledge from an area model to a linear model to identify or represent fractions. [This paper is written in both Spanish and English.

              "This paper presents an analysis of fractions errors displayed by learners due to deficient mastery of prerequisite concepts. Fractions continue to pose a critical challenge for learners. Fractions can be a tricky concept for learners although they often use the concept of sharing in their daily lives. 30 purposefully sampled learners participated in this study. The research instrument consists of fractions test whose questions were selected from various Annual National Assessment examination papers containing in addition, subtraction multiplication and division of fractional operations. The different types of errors displayed by learners were then identified, coded and categorized. The analysis showed that the main sources for errors were lack of understanding of the basic concepts, learners' prior knowledge, misconceptions and misapplication of rules. This study recommends that teachers should help their learners to develop fractions conceptual understanding. Learners need to be explicitly taught that errors are opportunities for learning, and that they are springboard of inquiry.",

Moreover, given the current importance of STEM content in education (White House, 2009), a closer look at the SIOP Model specifically in mathematics instruction seems warranted. To address more precisely the achievement gap in the Gr. 4 NAEP Mathematics scores of English Learners, examining SIOP-Model teaching related to the topic of fractions, which is central to the Grades 3-4 CCSS-M Standards, would be particularly timely.   Finally, it seems prudent to strategically incorporate into the SIOP-Model teaching of Gr. 3-4 fractions the two recommendations for teaching English Learners that have strong evidence according to a recent U.S. Department of Education Institute of Educational Sciences Practice Guide (Baker, et al., 2014, p.  6): Recommendation one  Teach a set of academic vocabulary words intensively across several days using a variety of instructional activities. • Choose a brief, engaging piece of informational text that includes academic vocabulary as a platform for intensive academic vocabulary instruction.   • Choose a small set of academic vocabulary for in-depth instruction.   • Teach academic vocabulary in depth using multiple modalities (writing, speaking, listening).   • Teach word-learning strategies to help students independently figure out the meaning of words.   Recommendation two  Integrate oral and written English language instruction into content-area teaching.",

Third, collaboration among content teachers, ESL teachers, and \nschool administrators creates open communication to take initiative in sharing effective strategies that can be \neasily applied and challenges that can be addressed. \n \nEvery teacher should know how to serve English Learners because nearly all teachers today have or will have \nELs in their classrooms.

The data from our study suggest that it took 5 to 6 years of instruction for ELLs to overcome the language demands of mathematics word problems in standardized achievement test. This result is true for both the Chinese and Spanish-speaking groups which have  very different achievement profiles with the \nformer achieving significantly above the national norm and the latter significantly lower than the national norm in mathematics.  \nIt is important to note that our results showed that the Chinese-speaking ELLs were affected \nby the language interference of the word problem s even when they were achieving significantly \nabove the national norm in mathematics. However, our results also show that the Chinese-speaking ELLs took one less year than the Spanish-speaking students to reach parity with students in the national norm. We do not know if this is related  to the different achievement profiles of the two \ngroups. Does the higher achievement of the Chinese-speaking ELLs in mathematics allow them to overcome the language demands of the word problems in a shorter time? Or is the difference a function of the different education programs for Chinese- and Spanish-speaking ELLs enrolled in \nSFUSD?

Fraction Face-Off! is a revision of Fuchs et al. (2013; 2014). The lesson guides provide a model for each lesson and the language of explanations. Tutors reviewed but did not read from or memorize guides. Prior to delivering lessons, tutors practiced delivering lessons to fellow tutors. All this helped promote a high level of implementation fidelity while preserving teaching authenticity and responsiveness to student misunderstandings.  Content. The focus on the measurement interpretation of fractions was achieved primarily through instruction and activities involving comparing, ordering, placing fractions on number lines, and equivalencies. To build on classroom instruction, this focus was preceded by attention to part-whole interpretation (e.g., showing objects with shaded regions) and equal sharing examples. Number lines, fraction tiles, and fraction circles were used throughout the 36 lessons. Initial instruction relied on a combination of part/whole relations and equal sharing; then, the focus emphasized measurement understanding. See Table 2 for the sequence in which topics were introduced. Note that (a) after a topic was introduced, it was cumulatively reviewed; (b) ~85% of content was allocated to understanding fractions and WPs (rather than calculations); and (c) A-WPs (but not M-WPs) required adding/subtracting fractions to find solutions.

In this paper we explore a form of blended learning in which upper elementary school students learn fractions by rotating between computer-based instruction and teacher-led instruction during the same class period. The intervention discussed in this paper took place in three fifth-grade* mathematics classrooms at a public school in Middle Tennessee. It was one of a series of research studies completed as part of a three-year, education technology development project called HALF (Helping At-Risk Students Learn Fractions). The goal of the HALF project, which began in June of 2010, is to design and pilot test a complete, blended learning intervention program that teaches basic fractions concepts.  Small group instruction is an essential component of the HALF instructional model, which is similar in many ways to the instructional model for the READ 180 intervention program (Mayer, Alexander, De Vivo, Aguhob, Davidson, 2013). READ 180 is among the most successful reading intervention programs on the market today and has been in use in America’s schools for more than 15 years. HALF, like READ 180, uses a rotational model that has been found to be extremely successful in elementary, middle, and high school classes (Slavin, Cheung, Groff, & Lake, 2008; Lang, Torgesen, Petscher, Vogel, Chanter, Lefsky, 2009). Students begin each day of the HALF intervention program with a brief whole class discussion. After the discussion, students begin one of three rotations: computer-based adaptive instruction",

We explore bilingual French \nimmersion students’ linguistic and mathema tical repertoires as they work through a series of \nprobability problems. Focusing on the collaborative dialogue that occurred between students and \nresearchers, our discourse analysis was informed by sociocultural theory and systemic functional \nlinguistics.  Findings indicate that students’ linguistic and mathematical repertoires are intertwined, \nand that collaboration can offer opportunities for supporting bilingual learners’ language and \nmathematics development. We conclude with implications and challenges for bilingual mathematics \neducation.  \nKeywords: Classroom Discourse; Instructional Activities and Practices; Probability  \nOne of the most novel characteristics of French immersion programs is that students whose first \nlanguage is not French learn this target language not only through French language classes but also",

Moreover , research in mathematics education has argued that bi - and multilingual learners use \ntheir first language, home language(s), or shared language(s)  as a resource for mathematical learning \nand that it plays an important social and political role (e.g., Adle r, 1999; Barwell, 2014; \nMoschkovich, 2005; Planas  & Setati -Phakeng, 2014). Barwell and Setati (2005) , for example,  have \nurged mathematics educators to find “ways of dealing with linguistic diversity that avoid reducing \nmathematics classroom interaction to a monolingual (English language) norm” (p. 23). Although the \nresearch contexts referred to here are varied and each is unique, codeswitching is a phenomenon that \nseems to occur throughout. A sociocultural theoretical framework th at views language as a medi ator \nof thought and as a cognitive tool, allows us to view students’ codeswitching in this study  as a \nresource for mathematical and language l earning, rather than a problem or deficit to be overcome . \nImplications and challenges  \nThe two excerpts featured he re point toward implications, and corresponding challenges, for \nmathematics educators working in bi - and multilingual contexts. First, we suggest that providing \nopportunities for students to engage in collaborative dialogue with each other and with their t eacher \nis important mathematically, linguistically, and socially.

              "or at the level of blocks of speech” ( Baker, 2011, p. 107), this phenomenon has been explored in both \nmathematics and second language education contexts. As scholars in both fields have explained, \nhistorically codeswitching has been perceived as indica tive of a deficiency with regard to bilingual \nstudents’ mathematics and language proficiency. Recent work, however, has challenged this view. \nResearchers have argued for a positive, resource -oriented view of bilingual learners that recognizes \nthe resources  they bring to the mathematics classroom and, in line with sociocultural theory, this may \ninclude learners’ first or home language(s). This approach challenges the monolingual norm and \nviews codeswitching as socially and cognitively complex. However, codes witching remains a \ncontentious and controversial issue and the use of multiple languages in the mathematics classroom \noften conflicts with political agendas and language policy goals (Adler, 1999; Barwell, 2009b, 2014; \nCummins, 2007; Moschkovich, 2005; Planas & Setati -Phakeng, 2014 ; Swain & Lapkin, 2000 ; \nTurnbull & Dailey -O’Cain, 2009; Setati & Adler, 2000 ). \nSecond language learning through content  \nWith regard to second language learning in mathematics, two key sociocultural concepts emerge \nthat are pertine nt to our analysis.

When viewed through a sociocultural \ntheory lens, in the first excerpt, the learners, through the scaffolded guidance provided by the \ninterviewer -researcher, are able to go farther, mathematically and linguistically, than they may have \nbeen able to individually. Through the interviewer -researcher’s introduction of the term \n“absolument ”, students are able to pick up that language and use it to explore the mathematical \nconcept of certainty. Similar to the reflexive relationship described by Barwell (2005), in this study \nstudents’ mathematical understanding of the probability -related concept of certainty develops in an \ninterwoven fashion with their linguistic  understanding.  \nIn the second interaction, students engage in a phenomenon that is of particular interest to many \nworking in bilingual mathematics classrooms —codeswitching.

              "FRACTION INTERVENTION -10       (but in some analyses, we multiplied scores by -1). Test-retest reliability, on a sample of 63 students across 2 weeks, was .80.  To index skill with fraction procedures, we administered two subtests from the 2012 Fraction Battery (Schumacher, Namkung, Malone, & Fuchs, 2012). Fraction Addition includes five addition problems with like denominators and seven addition problems with unlike denominators, six presented vertically and six horizontally. Fraction Subtraction includes six subtraction problems with like denominators and six with unlike denominators, six presented vertically and six horizontally. For each subtest, administration is terminated when all but two students are finished. One point is awarded for finding the correct numerical answer; 2 if the item is appropriately reduced one time (7 items on addition; 8 items on subtraction); 3 if the item is appropriately reduced two times (1 subtraction item). We used the total score across the tests, which correlated .83. The maximum score is 41. Alpha on this sample was .91 - .94.  To index generalized learning about fractions, we administered 19 released items from 1990-2009 NAEP (U.S. Department of Education, 2010): easy, medium, or hard fraction items from the fourth-grade assessment and easy from the eighth-grade assessment. Testers read each problem aloud (with up to one rereading upon request). Eight items assess the part-whole interpretation (e.g., given a rectangle divided into six equal parts, students are directed to shade 1/3); nine assess measurement interpretation (e.g., given four lists of three fractions, students identify which are arranged from least to greatest); one requires subtraction with like denominators; and one asks how many fourths make a whole.

We did not collect demographic data or individually administered test data on NAR students. (Because the study was not about NAR students, we judged it inappropriate to spend their school time on the individual assessment battery or to ask teachers to complete demographic forms on these students. Also, resources did not permit us to administer the individual test battery to an additional 290 children.) Screening Measures The mathematics screening measure was WRAT-4-Arithmetic (Wilkinson & Robertson, 2006), with which students complete calculation problems of increasing difficulty. Alpha on this sample was .74. The IQ screening measure was the WASI (Weschler, 1999), which includes two tests. With Vocabulary, students identify pictures and define words. With Matrix Reasoning, students select 1 of 5 options that best completes a visual pattern. Reliability exceeds .92.   Fraction Measures To assess the measurement interpretation of fractions, we used Fraction Number Line (Hamlett, Schumacher, & Fuchs, 2011, adapted from Siegler et al., 2011), which requires students to place proper fractions, improper fractions, and mixed numbers on a number line labeled with endpoints (0 and 2). In each trial, a target fraction appears in a large font above the number line. Students practice with two fractions and then estimate the location of 20 items: 12/13, 7/9, 5/6, ¼, 2/3, ½, 1/19, 3/8, 7/4, 3/2, 4/3, 7/6, 15/8, 1 1/8, 1 1/5, 1 5/6, 1 2/4, 1 11/12, 5/5, and 1.

              "FRACTION INTERVENTION -24       together, we ran multilevel regression models examining intervention effects on each fraction outcome while accounting for nesting at the classroom level. Results did not alter any inferences based on single-level models. Given these results along with the fact that random assignment was conducted at the individual student level, we report single-level analyses.  We then confirmed that pretest performance of the three AR groups on each fraction measure was comparable. Next, because we relied on a residualized change approach to analyze effects of study condition (i.e., covarying pretest performance to reduce within-group error variance), we assessed the homogeneity of regression assumption, which was met for all measures except M-WPs, F(2,207) = 21.80, p < .001. Therefore, in the model involving that measure, we controlled for the interaction between pretest M-WP scores and condition. Does Intervention Enhance the Measurement Interpretation of Fractions, Fraction Calculations, and Generalized Fraction Knowledge over Control Group Performance?  To test our first hypothesis, that intervention results in superior learning compared to the business-as-usual condition, we conducted 1-way analyses of covariance (with treatment condition as the factor) on each fraction outcome, while controlling for the pretest score on the relevant measure. (For the M-WP outcome, we also controlled for the interaction between pretest and condition.) As shown in Table 4 and Figure 1, the intervention effect was significant on each outcome. To evaluate pairwise comparisons for significant effects, we used the Fisher least significant difference post hoc procedure (Seaman, Levin, & Serlin, l991). Posttest scores on number line, NAEP, and calculations, controlled",

The intervention program, Fraction Face-Off! (Fuchs, Schumacher, Malone, & Fuchs, 2015), was organized in a manual that included materials and lessons guides for the 36 lessons. Fraction Face-Off! is a revision of Fuchs et al. (2013; 2014). The lesson guides provide a model for each lesson and the language of explanations. Tutors reviewed but did not read from or memorize guides. Prior to delivering lessons, tutors practiced delivering lessons to fellow tutors. All this helped promote a high level of implementation fidelity while preserving teaching authenticity and responsiveness to student misunderstandings.  Content. The focus on the measurement interpretation of fractions was achieved primarily through instruction and activities involving comparing, ordering, placing fractions on number lines, and equivalencies. To build on classroom instruction, this focus was preceded by attention to part-whole interpretation (e.g., showing objects with shaded regions) and equal sharing examples. Number lines, fraction tiles, and fraction circles were used throughout the 36 lessons. Initial instruction relied on a combination of part/whole relations and equal sharing; then, the focus emphasized measurement understanding. See Table 2 for the sequence in which topics were introduced. Note that (a) after a topic was introduced, it was cumulatively reviewed; (b) ~85% of content was allocated to understanding fractions and WPs (rather than calculations); and (c) A-WPs (but not M-WPs) required adding/subtracting fractions to find solutions.

In other words, when doing comparisons between the two parts, they \nuse expressions such as big and small about the parts (Nures and Brgant, 2008). For example, when \nusing the word 'half', a child uses it to express sometimes a small piece and sometimes a part close to a \nwhole. Such fractional expressions that students face in everyday life form the basis of a systematic \nfraction teaching (Olkun & Toluk Uçar, 2014). Being able to comprehend fractions and make \ndeductions about them will enable children to perform comparisons and ordering on fractions, and \nconsequently make calculations related to fractions (Kılıç & Özdaş, 2010). And, this seems to be \npossible only with an effective and efficient fraction teaching.",

At-risk 4th graders (n = 213) were randomly assigned at the individual level to receive the school’s business-as-usual program or 1 of 2 variants of the core fraction intervention (each 12 weeks, 3 sessions/week). In each session of the 2 variants, 28 min were identical, focused mainly on the measurement interpretation of fractions. The other 7 min addressed fraction WPs: multiplicative WPs versus additive WPs. Children were pre- and posttested on fraction understanding, calculations, and WPs. On understanding and calculations, both intervention conditions outperformed the control group, and the effect of intervention versus control on released fraction items from the National Assessment of Education",
              "Since future research on teaching fractions among elementary students is \nimportant, instruction coding focuses on operational definitions of conceptual and \nprocedural knowledge adapted from previous studies (Anderson, et al., 2001 , p. 46; \nMisquitta, 2011; Roesslein & Codding, 2019) . Therefore, the definitions may differ in \ndifferent studies. The authors in current review coded the criteria for the knowledge accordingly but did not explicitly relate how the codes affect fractions understanding. \nHence, this springs out the suggestion for future study. In coding representation \nelements, the authors relied on the descriptions in abstract, methodology and results in particular the procedures, measures and figures related to fractions. Figures and \nverbalization in written form are useful guidance to obtain necessary codings for the \nrespective representation elements in the review.",
              "(reading), Pesen (2007) found that students had many misconceptions about these thre e \nconcepts. The misconceptions of the verbal expression of fractions indicate that students do \nnot learn mathematics language well. Yavuz -Mumcu (2015) stated that students failed to \nperceive comma as a reagent in the decimal fractions and ignored using the m. They placed it \nin the place of the division line and were unable to understand the digit value. Therefore, it is \nunderstood that students are faced with many mistakes because they cannot read and \nunderstand the fractional language of decimals sufficient ly. MLSFT scale with primary school \nchildren was designed to improve both mathematical knowledge and mathematical language. \nGiven the significant amount of specific variance accounted for in early numeracy with the \naid of mathematical language, the languag e element of mathematics may be one of those \ncomplex aspects accounting for significant variance in later literacy skills. As such, in",
              "in current study spoken representation is emphasized less than the verbalization in written form. Additionally, it is suggested for future researches to observe the effects of both elements on students’ communications skills and understanding fractions. \nTherefore, it is hoped  that fractions difficulty and misconception can be overcome not \nonly among elementary students but also among upper- grade level and up to higher \neducation students as it has been highlighted for the past three decades (Behr et al ., \n1983 ; Hoch, Reinhold, Werner, Richter -Gebert, & Reiss, 2018).  \nOne of the reasons for fractions difficulty is due to its various definitions. It is \nshown in this review that the representations of fractions appear in a symbolic number of fractions (numerator over denominator), decimals or percentages. \nHowever, the symbolic numbers were utilized in most of the reviewed studies also involve whole numbers, especially when a number line was applied.

The findings  in this study  reveal uncertainty \nand wide differences between the student teachers when solving fraction tasks that \nthey were  already familiar with; two of the 59 participants solved correctly all tasks, \nwhereas some of them  gave only one or not any correct answer . Moreover, the \ndata indicate general limitations in the participants’ basic knowledge in \nmathematics . For example,  many of them make errors in using mathematical \nsymbol writing and  different representation forms, and they do not recognize \nunreasonable  answers and incorrect statements . Some participants also seemed to \nguess at an algorithm to use when they did not remember or understand the \ncorrect solution method.  \nKeywords:  common content knowledge , elementary school , fractions , student \nteacher , teacher education \n1 Introduction",

Fraction Measures To assess the measurement interpretation of fractions, we used Fraction Number Line (Hamlett, Schumacher, & Fuchs, 2011, adapted from Siegler et al., 2011), which requires students to place proper fractions, improper fractions, and mixed numbers on a number line labeled with endpoints (0 and 2). In each trial, a target fraction appears in a large font above the number line. Students practice with two fractions and then estimate the location of 20 items: 12/13, 7/9, 5/6, ¼, 2/3, ½, 1/19, 3/8, 7/4, 3/2, 4/3, 7/6, 15/8, 1 1/8, 1 1/5, 1 5/6, 1 2/4, 1 11/12, 5/5, and 1. Items are presented in random order. The score for each item is the absolute difference between the child’s placement and the correct position. Scores are averaged across the 20 items and divided by 2. When multiplied by 100, scores are equivalent to the percent of absolute error (PAE), as",
              "and depends on formal instruction. The NMAP (2008) hypothesized that improvement in measurement interpretation is an important mechanism explaining the development of fraction knowledge and recommended that fraction instruction be reoriented in this direction. Our findings support that hypothesis, while corroborating recent prior work (Fuchs et al., 2013; 2014).  At the same time, because NAEP was the most distal measure in the present study, covering multi-faceted forms of fraction knowledge as well as response formats not addressed during intervention, it is not surprising that ESs (0.44 and 0.33) were smaller compared to ESs on more proximal measures (which ranged between 0.88 and 1.10). Even so, NAEP effects were significant and were in the moderate range according to the WWC’s guidelines. Moreover, the NAEP achievement gap decreased markedly for intervention students (a decrease in ES of 0.23 SD units for M-WP and 0.17 for A-WP), while the gap increased by 0.18 for at-risk control group students.
